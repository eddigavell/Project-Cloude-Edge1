Description
This is a 3 man project with the aim to create connection between an mqtt broker and a rasberry pi that will communicate with a relay that switches a power strip ( off <-> on ).
So in theory, you should be able to be in any location in the world, and by sending a ping to the chosen topic, turn the electricity off or on in your home. 
The devices that you chose to connect to that power strip is by your own choice.

Goal
The goal is to be able to make some kind of communication device that can be used by 2 people on diffrent sides of the world to communicate with by sending pings to a MQTT server.
The relay does not have to be attached to a power strip and could potentially work for anything with a flow of electricity.

Example implementations
* Glowing hearts used for couples to send ''love pings'' to eachother 
* Turning off power strips from phone
* SOS communication by light pings
